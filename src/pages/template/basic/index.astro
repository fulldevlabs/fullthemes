  <!-- FAQ -->
  <!-- How does vertical gardening work?
  Vertical gardening maximizes space by growing plants upwards instead of outwards. Our innovative systems utilize vertical structures to support plant growth, allowing you to grow more in less space.

  Are your gardening practices environmentally friendly?
  Yes, sustainability is at the core of what we do. We promote eco-friendly gardening techniques such as composting, rainwater harvesting, and organic pest control to minimize environmental impact.

  Can I grow food in an urban environment?
  Absolutely! Our solutions are tailored to urban environments, allowing you to grow a variety of fruits, vegetables, herbs, and flowers in limited spaces like balconies, rooftops, and small yards.

  I'm new to gardening. Is EcoGrow suitable for beginners?
  Definitely! Whether you're a novice or an experienced gardener, our resources and support are tailored to your needs. We offer educational workshops, personalized consultations, and a supportive community to help you succeed.
